# Installation

This backend service comes with an out-of-the-box installation, leveraging [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
Please ensure that Docker is installed on your computer (docker-compose version >= 1.25.5).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:immuni-app/immuni-backend-app-configuration.git
cd immuni-backend-app-configuration
git submodule update --init
cd docker
docker-compose build \
    --build-arg GIT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) \
    --build-arg GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD) \
    --build-arg GIT_TAG=$(git tag --points-at HEAD | cat) \
    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

The backend service can then be launched.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

At this point, the service is available at http://0.0.0.0:5000/swagger.
